**Logging in Linux**
  * Direct logging, services write to specific log files (Samba, Apache)
  * rsyslogd => service for managing centralized log files. Write the messages in different files in **/var/log/messages**
  * journald => with the introduction of systemd, the journald log service has been introduced sa well. Tightly integrated with systemd.
  
 **Logger** => enables users to write messages to rsyslog from the command line.
   
 **Rsyslog configuration**
   * Facility = Catherogy
   * Severity = Priority
