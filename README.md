# Linux-Course
Soft Intellect Linux Course

# Recommendations for the course:
* Think about the material, try to explain to yourself or to your classmates.
* Make all the homeworks, they are really important, do not skip any.
* Ask me as many questions as you want, it's not about how you look, it's about your knowledge after the course ends.
* Experiment in your virtual machine, do not be afrad, that's why it's virtual.
