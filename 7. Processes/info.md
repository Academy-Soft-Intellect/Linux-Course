- A process is a runing instace of a launched, executable program. You list your processes with 'ps' or 'top'. You typically care about the following process properties:  
  * states => running, sleeping.
  * ids => each process has an id.
  * parent => each process has a parent process, the ultimate parent process is 'systemd'.

- Running jobs in the foreground and background. Any executed program by default is ran as foreground job.
  * & (ampersand) in the end of the process will start the command immediately in the background.
  * Ctrl + Z => Stops the job temporarily so that it can be managed.
  * Ctrl + C => Cancel the current interactive job.
  * bg => Continues the job that has just been frozen using Ctrl + Z in the background.
  * fg => Brings the last job that was moved to background execution back to the foreground.
  * jobs => Shows which jobs are currently running from this shell. Display job numbers that can be used as an argument to the commands 'bg' and 'fg'.
  
- Sending a signal to a process.
  * 1 = Hangup = Report termination of the controlling process of a terminall
  * 9 = Kill = Causes program termination. Cannot be ignored, always fatal.
  * 15 = Terminate = The defauilt kill signal, it asks politely the program to terminate.
  
- Process priority => by default is 20. The more negavite you go, the bigger the priority becomes. 

- Showing processes:
  * top
  * ps -ef | ps aux
