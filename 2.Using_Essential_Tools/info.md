- Alias: a shortcut, usually located in ~/.bashrc.
- After alias creation, reload the shell 'exec bash'.
- I/O redirection: getting the output of a command/s and putting it inside a file/special file.
* '>' redirects STDOUT and overrides previous content.
* '>>' redirects STDOUT and appends to previous content.
* '2>' redirects STDERR.
* '2>$1' redirects STDERR to the same destination as STDOUT.
- Man pages, extremely important. [Man pages based on section](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/)
- /usr/share/doc is another location, where documentation might be found. Usually each rpm package comes with a documentation, which is located there.
- Find/Grep: looking for information. 
    1. Find: search for files.
    2. Grep: grep files matching a pattern.
