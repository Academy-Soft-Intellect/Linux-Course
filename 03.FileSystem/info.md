- The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS): defines the directory structure and directory contents in Unix-like operating systems. [FHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard)
- In RedHat 7 the /bin, /sbin, /lib and /lib64 directories are now under the /usr directory. 
- Working with files commands: cp, mv and rm.
- INode: a data structure used to represent a filesystem object (file, directory). File systems (ext family, xfs) cares about Inodes, humans care about names. 
- Soft link: softlink is just a pointer with dummy values, it resolves the name of the file each time you access it through the symlink.
- Hard link: directory entry (a file) pointing to the same inode.
- tar: software utility for collecting many files into one archive file.
- gzip: compression (a way of reducing the size of a file on disk using different algorithms and mathematical calculations ) utility.
- du: estimate file space usage.

Usually tar and gzip are runned together.

Side note:
I will be outside of Bulgaria from 9th to 13th May.
