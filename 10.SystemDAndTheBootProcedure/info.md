- **Systemd** is the first process in Linux, responsbile for staring all kinds of different units. Units could be services, sockets, mounts. The most important unit is the **service** unit.
 
  [SystemD in Fedora Documentation.](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Systemd)
 
- In Systemd, the OS is controlled in **targets**. Each target consists of a set of units. 
  1. poweroff.target
  2. rescue.target
  3. **multi-user.target**
  4. **graphical.target**
  5. reboot.target
  
- The **default configuration** is located in **/usr/lib/system/systemd**. You could override the defaults in **/etc/systemd/system**.

- **systemctl** is the command that rules the units.
  * E.g **systemctl status sshd**
  * E.g **systemctl is-enabled sshd**
  
 - Targets could be isolated if they have the **isolate** option. You always have a default target. **systemctl get-default**
 
 - GRUB2 boot loader is installed on the boot sector of your hard driver and configured to load a Linux kernel and initramfs.

 - **initramfs** a mini file system with drivers needed to continue the booting process ( LVM, SCSI modules for accessing disks)

 - **grub2-mkconfig** the right tool to change something inside your GRUB2 coniguration.
